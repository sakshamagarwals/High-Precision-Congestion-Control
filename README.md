# HPCC NS-3 simulator
This is an NS-3 simulator for HPCC: High Precision Congestion Control (SIGCOMM'19). It also includes the implementation of DCQCN, TIMELY, DCTCP, PFC, ECN and Broadcom shared buffer switch. The full paper can be found at: https://rmiao.github.io/publications/hpcc-li.pdf

It is based on NS-3 version 3.17.

If you have any questions, please contact Rui Miao (miao.rui@alibaba-inc.com).

## Quick Start

### Build
`./waf configure`

Please note if gcc version > 5, compilation will fail due to some ns3 code style.  If this what you encounter, please use:

`CC='gcc-5' CXX='g++-5' ./waf configure`

### Experiment config
Please see `mix/config.txt` for example. 

`mix/config_doc.txt` is a explanation of the example (texts in {..} are explanations).

### Run
The direct command to run is:
`./waf --run 'scratch/third exp/fattree/config-fattree.txt'`

We provide a `run.py` for automatically *generating config* and *running experiment*. Please `python run.py -h` for usage.
Example usage:
`python run.py --cc hp --trace flow --bw 100 --topo topology --hpai 50`
